## Practice Project: Secure Workloads with Azure Virtual Networking Services

I'm using the guided project from Microsoft Learn - [Configure secure access to workloads with Azure virtual networking services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/applied-skills/configure-secure-workloads-use-azure-virtual-networking/) - to practice building in Terraform.

The goal of this Microsoft Applied Skills credential is to demonstrate the ability to secure resources by using Azure virtual networking solutions.
