## Practice Project: Secure Workloads with Azure Virtual Networking Services

I'm using the guided project from Microsoft Learn - [Configure secure access to workloads with Azure virtual networking services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/applied-skills/configure-secure-workloads-use-azure-virtual-networking/) - to practice building in Terraform.

The goal of this Microsoft Applied Skills credential is to demonstrate the ability to secure resources by using Azure virtual networking solutions.

**Credential**: [Microsoft Applied Skills - Secure Workloads with Azure Virtual Networking](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/credentials/share/en-us/MartinBjrsbergkerlind-6520/9C4C046FFAD8E634?sharingId=4A9026F4A3566C4)

### Tasks Performed:

- **Create and configure virtual networks**: Setting up virtual networks to establish secure and isolated environments.
- **Configure network routing**: Managing and optimizing the flow of network traffic.
- **Create DNS zones and configure DNS settings**: Ensuring proper domain name resolution within the network.
- **Create and configure network security groups (NSGs)**: Implementing security rules to control inbound and outbound traffic.
- **Create and configure Azure Firewall**: Deploying a managed firewall to protect network resources.

### This Lab Contains:

- **Virtual Networks**: Fundamental building blocks for the virtual environment.
- **Subnets**: Dividing the virtual network into smaller, manageable sections.
- **Network Peering**: Connecting virtual networks to enable resource sharing.
- **Network Security Groups**: Defining security rules at the subnet and network interface levels.
- **Application Security Groups**: Grouping similar servers to simplify security management.
- **Firewall**: Implementing Azure Firewall for enhanced security.
- **Linux VMs**: Deploying Linux virtual machines for various workloads.
- **Route Table**: Customizing routes to control traffic flow.
- **Private DNS Zone**: Managing domain name resolution in a private network.
